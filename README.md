# PayPal-calculator-with-angularjs
PayPal calculator with angularjs, to calculate the fees charged by the platform when sending and receiving.

# Synopsis

# Features
* Sass
* Pup
* GruntJs
* Angulajs
* NodeJs

# Motivation

When making Paypal balance exchanges it becomes necessary to calculate the commissions, to know the net amount that we will receive. For this we developed a simple calculator in AngularJs.

For this project I wanted to use Pug which is a template engine of NodeJs to facilitate writing HTML, turn the style handle with sass. Everything was automated with the GruntJs task manager
